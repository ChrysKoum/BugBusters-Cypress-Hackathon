# BugBusters Cypress Integration Tests

## Overview
Welcome to the BugBusters Cypress Integration Tests repository! This project was developed as part of a competition hosted by Netcompany Intrasoft, where our team was tasked with creating a series of integration tests for the website [Rahul Shetty Academy's Practice Page](https://rahulshettyacademy.com/seleniumPractise/#/). Our tests are written in JavaScript using the Cypress framework, demonstrating our proficiency in automated testing and software quality assurance.
